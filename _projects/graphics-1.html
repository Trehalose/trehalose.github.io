		<h2>Blog Banners &amp; Content Illustrations</h2>
		<p>
			Not including the meme GIFs <small>(Pronounced with a soft G. <em>Fight me!</em>)</small>, 
			I create a majority of the illustrations used in Nihongo Familiar’s blog posts. 
			Most of these are filler &amp; fluff images, but occasionally I get an informational one.
		</p>
		<p>
			These are usually an exercise at meeting a good medium between trashy &amp; treasure; 
			quick &amp; quality; simple &amp; detailed— i.e. I am lazy, but want something that 
			is at least visually appealing and makes sense why I used it while I was reading the post.

		<h2>Ads &amp; Illustrations</h2>
		<p>
			I use product branding for creating ad content and other relevant 
			illustrations when they come up. Right now, the majority of that has 
			been for social media posting, and the occasional user testing printout.
		</p>
		<p>
			The examples here are meta images used for posting on social media for 
			<a href=”https://www.onkaado.com/” target=”_blank”>Onkaado</a> &amp; 
			<a href=”https://www.kanagories.com/” target=”_blank”>Kana-gories</a>.

		<h2>Other assets &amp; fluff</h2>
		<p>
			Occasionally I've needed to make more permanent assets for 
			functional purposes or simple graphic fluff. These usually 
			involve cute little images as a visual aside for important 
			text, or something added for extra visual flair.
		</p>
		<p>
			The examples here are a couple illustrations from the 
			<a href=”https://www.kanagories.com/” target=”_blank”>Kana-gories</a> 
			rule set, and an animation of a fairy carrying a card, a common motif  used with 
			<a href=”https://www.onkaado.com/” target=”_blank”>Onkaado</a>.
