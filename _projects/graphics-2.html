		<h2>Code Naked 2.0 T-shirt</h2>
		<h3>Backstory:</h3>
		<p>
			Sourcetoad sponsors &amp; likes to be part of a lot of tech events 
			in their area. They would give away t-shirts, since that is a big 
			draw for a lot of people that go to these events. One of the limited 
			shirts they used to give was one with a man coding naked at a computer, 
			with the text “Code Naked” on it.
		</p>
		<h3>Result:</h3>
		<p>
			Years later, they wanted to heavily lean on the fact that they work 
			with cruise lines; and they wanted a quirky shirt to represent that 
			while having a nod to the “Code Naked” shirt. I worked with the CEO 
			and Marketing Manager to get the sequel shirt they were looking for. 
			<em>It was a success!</em>
		</p>
		<h3>Hurdles:</h3>
		<p>
			The biggest hurdle of this experience is that I had a very limited 
			amount of colors I could use due to printing and cost limitations. 
			I was able to squeeze this into 6 colors, with the background blue 
			being the color of the t-shirts themselves as a little workaround.

		<h2>Lectern for the Loquacious</h2>
		<p>
			Our CEO wanted to have a fancy, company-branded lectern to use when
			he did official conference room presentations. He knew a woodworking
			guy, and needed some design ideas for what his lectern could look
			like. He asked me to get creative, so I offered up 3 quickie ideas
			for him to consider and brainstorm from. He actually ended up liking
			them as they were, and they went with the traditional middle one.
		</p>
		<p>
			The final lectern was built, and was blue instead of wood-coloured.
			Unfortunately, I never got a picture of it before I stopped working
			there. Maybe someday I'll go back and snag that to update this~

		<h2>UI Designs</h2>
		<p>
			When a client needed some design work, but didn’t have an immediate 
			design team available, I was the team Sourcetoad member with the 
			most design experience that was called to action.
		</p>
		<p>
			One project that stood out the most in this regard was a kiosk 
			shipping product called uShipIt. I worked on wireframes, mockups, 
			and development for this application.
		</p>
		<p>
			These are screenshots from one of the example mock sets. This was 
			the base design that was selected for the end product, but there 
			were changes here and there during the development phase to things 
			like iconography and minor color scheme shifts.
