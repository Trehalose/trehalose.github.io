<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	I was in a personal rut, and just needed to ship a quick, small project that 
	I could show off and feel like I “completed” even if I never went back to it 
	again. It fit with my language learning goals and nostalgia for board games 
	to make it the game that it was.

		<h2>Process</h2>
		<div class="tabbed">
			<p>
				I already had the game idea I wanted to try via an epiphany moment. 
				The rest of planning was about refinement for the purpose of language 
				learning. It also needed to be as simple as possible because I wanted 
				this project to be short &amp; sweet. Here is how it went~
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					I started off researching similar games &amp; postulating 
					how I could convert for a language study experience.
				</li>
				<li>
					I planned out 3 basic screens/sections that would matter most for the MVP:
					<ul>
						<li>Rules</li>
						<li>Settings</li>
						<li>he game itself <small>(which is just data and a timer)</small></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>I wireframed ideas for the screen layouts on mobile &amp; desktop.</li>
				<li>I designed mockups for the screens. I wasn't sure about color schemes yet, so it was all in greyscale.</li>
				<li>I coded the screens based on the mockups.</li>
				<li>Made the first releases, &amp; got feedback to iterate on.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

<div class="mb-1 flexer col-reverse md-row">
	<div>
		<h2>Hurdles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Figuring out a colour scheme for the project.
				<ul>
					<li>Usually I do design up-front, but for whatever reason, this game me trouble.</li>
					<li>I eventually got there with 3 days of mood boarding &amp; fretting.</li>
					<li>The deciding factor was just going with my gut &amp; not looking back</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>What would I improve?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Better accessibility.
				<ul>
					<li>Specifically, for tabbing fixes.</li>
					<li>More broadly, any improvements in general.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Based on feedback, support for different learning levels.</li>
		</ul>
