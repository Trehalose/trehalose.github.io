<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  I want to create useful tools to help myself study Japanese, and I would like 
  to share my findings and effort with others in their quest to do the same.

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="flexer col md-row">
  <div class="tabbed">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Heroku</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Familiarity with the platform.</li>
          <li>
            Historically great for testing applications for free.
            <ul>
              <li>A decision I would come to regret later.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>GhostCMS <small>(later switched to Jekyll on Github Pages)</small></strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Easy “set and forget” options with Heroku.</li>
          <li>Node compatible.</li>
          <li>A fun new learning experience!</li>
          <li>Full frontend theming.</li>
          <li>It has a cool name! <br /><small>(Look, I know that isn't the most responsible way to make a decision, but damn it, coolness used to mean something!)</small></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Github Pages</strong>
        <ul>
          <li>Best financial option with easy access.</li>
          <li>A new learning experience I can use later!</li>
          <li>Full frontend theming.</li>

    <h2>Hurdles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Heroku had a major pricing shift &amp; loss of feature support in late 2022.
        <ul>
          <li>I had to do lots of research &amp; a hosting platform shift.</li>
          <li>I switched to Github Pages with the Jekyll framework.</li>
          <li>I lost a lot of features by switching away from Ghost, but Jekyll + Pages is a sick combo!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Setting up an S3 server with AWS was a process.
        <ul>
          <li>There is a reason AWS has whole certification programs.</li>
          <li>I got it set up with a lot of Stack Overflow help, but still not sure if I did it securely.</li>
          <li>Switching to Github Pages fixed my ever-lingering concerns!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Setting up blogging with the Ghost CMS.</li>
      <li>Setting up blogging with Jekyll.</li>
      <li>AWS is very vast and intimidating. It is way above my pay grade.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I kind of already did do it again while switching from Heroku to Github Pages, lol.
        <ul>
          <li>Implemented big money savings.</li>
          <li>I had a lot of doubts about the security of my instance of S3.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>If I had the time, I would probably learn more about AWS, &amp; switch to it's tools.</li>
    </ul>
