description: "While at Tampa Bay WaVE, I created a LOT of design media. Most of it was a variety of web advertisements, printed flyers, and signs for the coworking space."

		<h2>Banner stands</h2>
		<p>
			This was a set of 3 banner stands that we got printed to bring 
			to events. The tallest one was taller than me once they were all 
			printed. Amazing— at least from my perspective! 
		</p>
		<p>
			They took a lot of my computer's processing power and space, 
			unfortunately. So it took hours to get these bad boys exported 
			for the printers.

		<h2>Metrics postcard</h2>
		<p>
			This was a cute, little postcard sized flyer that displayed some 
			quick metrics about WaVE at the time. This was made near the end 
			of my term at the company, and marked the start of a shift in 
			design/brand changes we were moving toward. <em>It looks even more 
			slick and modern~</em>

		<h2>Conference room signs</h2>
		<p>
			In contrast to the metrics flyer, these little signs were some 
			of the earliest things I designed at WaVE. I was requested to 
			make quirky stickers to help people work around the fact that 
			the conference room doors needed to be pushed open with pull-handles.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our Operations Manager at the time really wanted to reference 
			the Salt-N-Pepa song, and the other one was to be some kind of 
			innuendo. If it is not completely obvious at this point, my 
			early days with WaVE had a completely different vibe when I 
			started there than by the time I left. <small>That isn't a 
			bad or a good thing— more so an interesting thing I noticed 
			as I was posting this.</small>
