<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	I wanted to learn web development, and also use the Wanikani API to 
	make a game. Nobody had done that at the time yet, so it would have 
	been impressive to that community. Much time has passed, so I am sure 
	many others have followed in my footsteps.

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
	<p>
		I winged this one. I just wrote down the gist of the game idea, and went to 
		work learning jQuery and coding it in tandem. I made the graphics 
		earlier in the process, &amp; the sound effects later in the process. 
		Other than that, it was so long ago that I really don't remember much 
		about the specifics.

</div>

<h2>Hurdles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		I had no idea how API's worked.
		<ul>
			<li>This was a beginner frontend-only application, so no backend help.</li>
			<li>I solved most of my issues with JSONP being an offering of Wanikani's API at the time.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Firefox was the only browser that ever gave me functionality problems.
		<ul>
			<li>I still don't know why, but I just banned Firefox users. <small>(Not the correct decision)</small></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

		<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
		<p>
			I have learned a TON about web programming since I made this game, 
			but this was my initial foray into it. I owe a lot to this baby~
			<br /><br />
			My biggest takeaways were:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>About APIs</li>
			<li>Adding sound to a webpage.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
		<p>
			This was my first real web development project. There are <em>so</em> 
			many ways I would improve it compared to what I know now. 
			<br /><br />
			These are only a few:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A better, more readable tutorial that isn't just a JPG.</li>
			<li>Add a scoreboard, as per the suggestion of the Wanikani community.</li>
			<li>
				Use vanilla Javascript.
				<ul>
					<li>jQuery was only useful for the comet explosion effect &amp; making simple API calls back then.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Use the Canvas API to render it.</li>
		</ul>
