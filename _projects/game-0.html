<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  It was finally time I bite the bullet and learn Unity. This is my first project with it. 
  Even if it is a pretty basic game, I wasn't following a step-by-step tutorial to make it; 
  but rather, I made it with the knowledge I gathered from learning Unity's basics from 
  their foundational lesson course.

    <div class="tabbed">
      <p>
        I was reading through beginner tutorials for Unity, trying to figure out what to do for my 
        first project when I got a gist of the overall system. Near the end of one, that was 
        going over 2D gravity &amp; collisions, it mentioned a Pachinko game as a project to try 
        out a user's newly learned collision skills. I digged the idea, &amp; went with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't really look at any of the directions after that point because I was confident in 
        my ability to set up the base system and find what I needed to set up the next steps. 
        So I set up the basic layout and collisions for the pegs that the ball hits.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, I planned what would make it more interesting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Score tracking</li>
        <li>A cute sprite that reacts to score changes</li>
        <li>All vibes~</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I imported a <a href="https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/2d-character-sprite-animation-penguin-236747" target="_blank">free penguin sprite</a> 
        asset from the Unity Asset Store for the game's fluff character. 
        I learned how to add its built in animation events to the scene's 
        sprite instance, and added my own in there as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I added code components to the ball, penguin, and trigger events 
        when the ball hit any of the ice floors.

    <h2>Hurdles</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Figuring out how to connect different GameObjects in GUI's with manually written C# scripts.</li>
    <li>Figuring out how sprite animations work.
      <ul>
      <li>Using transform parameters are not relative to the sprite prefab, but based on scene's coordinates(?/.)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Making a build cuts off the default viewport size that Unity sets for the game.
      <ul>
      <li>This one makes me angry.</li>
      <li>I used a workaround by making the executable window resizable.</li>
