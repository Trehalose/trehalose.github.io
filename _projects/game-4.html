description: "A game I made using Tofugu's Wanikani API to help players study their kanji. It is a simple raindrop style game where the user catches falling food. Each food has a word or kanji on it. The user has to match it to the character's craving."

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
  I wanted to make a different type of game with the Wanikani API than 
  <a href="/game/wanicomets/" target="_self" title="Wanicomets">my previous one</a>. 
  Something with more real-time interactions that felt more &ldquo;game-like&rdquo;. 
  I was still a developer n00b though, so it still had to be simple. Other than a 
  block matcher, which I had already done before in C# &amp; the XNA framework, 
  the next simplest idea that came to mind was a raindrop game!

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="tabbed">
  <p>
    Much like with <a href="/game/wanicomets/" target="_self">Wanicomets</a>, 
    I winged it with this project. I wrote down the basic game idea, &amp; 
    continued my experience learning jQuery while I was coding. When I needed 
    a break, I started making graphics &amp; audio for the game. Other than 
    that, it was so long ago that I really don't remember more of the specifics.

<h2>Hurdles</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    This was my second web development project, so most of the hurdles 
    were about practicing &amp; getting better at jQuery &amp; Javascript.
  </li>
  <li>
    Firefox was the only browser that ever gave me functionality problems.
    <ul>
      <li>I still don't know why, but I just banned Firefox users. <small>(Not the correct decision)</small></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>More jQuery &amp; Javascript</li>
      <li>Taking user inputs to make character movements.</li>
      <li>Timers</li>

    <h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I'm not sure how yet, but I would refine the gameplay in some way.
        <ul>
          <li>Maybe make the timer shorter.</li>
          <li>Maybe add more interesting rules to add a challenge.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Add settings to modify things like the timer.</li>
      <li>Update the graphics to use animation timers instead of GIFs.</li>
