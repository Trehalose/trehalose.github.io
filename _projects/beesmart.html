<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	For the agency I worked at, we had a client who wanted to make this application.
	It was his baby, &amp; we wanted to help bring it to the world!
	I got to have a lot of client interaction, which really helped understand the
	product goals &amp; brand needs.

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="flexer col md-row">
	<div class="tabbed">
		<ul>
			<li>My day-to-day on this project consisted of meetings with my team, picking up tickets, &amp; coding them.
			</li>
			<li>At later points, I was involved more directly in the meetings with the client as a support project
				manager
				(PM).</li>
		</ul>

</div>

<h2>Hurdles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		We had some initial HIPAA compliance issues
		<ul>
			<li>This involved extra meetings &amp; addressing them in our API.</li>
			<li>We implemented some security features to hide &amp; timeout information when the app was not focused.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		We ended up losing a PM <small>(not in a dead way, don't worry!)</small> &amp; had no PMs familiar enough with
		the
		project to fill the role.
		<ul>
			<li>As the most familiar team member, I was able to help fill the role until we could hire a dedicated PM.
			</li>
			<li>I helped train &amp; get the new PM up to speed.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Applying accessibility &amp; internationalization to a mobile app</li>
	<li>Vue.js</li>
	<li>Tailwind</li>
</ul>
<img class="bordered img-wide hauto md-img-half mb-1 md-mb-0 md-mr-1" src="/assets/imgs/beesmart/pharm-dash.png" alt="Screenshot of the BeeSmart pharmacy panel." />

<h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Insist on deeper research for major compliance requirements before tickets are made.</li>
	<li>
		Request to be part of more client meetings at the start. Hot take, but I feel like for
		any agency, developers should always be part of direct client interactions.
	</li>
</ul>
