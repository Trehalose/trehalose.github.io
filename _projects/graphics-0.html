description: "One of my favourite things to design are logos. Here is a big honkin' list of logos I've designed."

<h2>Onkaado</h2>
<div class="flexer col-reverse mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		This logo was made for a <a href="https://www.onkaado.com/" target="_blank">Japanese language study game</a>. 
		The only major requirement for it was to have a fairy in refrence to the not-yet designed mascot of the game. 
		The logo would be used as a blueprint for said mascot.
		<br /><br />
		For the fairy look in the logomark, I drew a lot of inspiration from mayflies &amp; butterflies. 
		The goal was to try and simplify an idea of a fairy as much as possible and use aspects of flat 
		design to give a polished and more reverent nod to the functional minimalism of classic 8-bit games.
		<br /><br />
		The typefaces used in the logo were chosen to reflect a world with a more "classical" 
		impression of magic; one where it is traditionally conjured through incantation &amp; ritual. 
		This was intended to go hand-in-hand with the scholarly aspect of the application it was 
		made to represent.

<h2 class="mt-1">Kana-gories!</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		This logo was made for a 
		<a href="https://www.kanagories.com/" target="_blank">Japanese language study game</a>. 
		The goal was to make something simple, cute, and light. 
		The result was a logo that was text-heavy, 
		but leveraged color and animation to emphasize the 
		lightheartedness of it as a simple game and focus on 
		the topic of Japanese language.

</div>

<h2 class="mt-1">Nihongo Familiar</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row-reverse">
	<p>
		This logo was made for a 
		<a href="https://www.nihongo-familiar.com/" target="_blank">Japanese language learning blog</a>.
		It takes inspiration in part from "tanzaku", a paper 
		used to write hopes and wishes during the Japanese holiday 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanabata" target="_blank">Tanabata</a> 
		and koinobori, carp shaped windsocks used during Japan's 
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_Day_(Japan)" target="_blank">Children's Day</a>. 
		The intended vibe of the logo was to provide a bit of low-key 
		cheering and fanfare for people working hard to learn and grow 
		during their Japanese studies.

<h2 class="mt-1">Bee's Baketorium</h2>
<div class="flexer col-reverse mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		A cute little logo featuring the head pâtissier in a 
		<a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/BeesBaketorium" target="_blank">small bakery operation</a>! 
		My client requested that I added a lot of bees, and damn it, that was 100% 
		aligned with things I love to do!
		<br /><br />
		For this particular project, I worked directly with the client 
		in an iterative approach in order to reach the logo of her dreams.
		<br /><br />
		I am especially pleased with this one because flat design rarely 
		uses a smear &amp; splatter effects. You could say that was the cherry on top for me~

<h2 class="mt-1">Horror Makes Us Happy .com</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row-reverse">
	<p>
		A logo submitted for <a href="https://horrormakesushappy.com/" target="_blank">a podcast</a>, 
		it ended up being accepted among the logos intended for use in
		stickers and other print collateral. They wanted something classy, but horror inspired.

<h2 class="mt-1">Connechub</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		This is logo for a video classifieds 
		<a href="https://www.connechub.com/" target="_blank">web app</a>. 
		Connechub needed a logo to kickstart the emerging designs of their company. 
		I worked directly with their team to create the logo that suited their brand's vision.

<h2 class="mt-1">hyve</h2>
<div class="flexer col-reverse mb-1 md-row-reverse">
	<p>
		Working alongside David Castaneda on StartupBus 2019, 
		we created the logo for an <a href="https://hyve.email/" target="_blank">email security company</a>. 
		<br /><br />
		My contribution initially focused on the typeface used for the logo, 
		but after some time and internal changes for the team, I was tasked to 
		updated the logomark in minor ways to better reflect the company's 
		changes in design needs.

<h2 class="mt-1">Glass Table</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		Working alongside James Blevins, we created the logo design for this 
		startup during a StartupBus competition. My contribution focused on 
		the logomark of the design, as well as the color scheme.
		<br /><br />
		We created horizontal, vertical, and black-and-white iterations of the logo.

<h2 class="mt-1">TimeWhiz</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row-reverse">
	<p>
		This is a logo I put together for a web development project I worked on 
		to learn the MEAN stack. Initially this was part of an inappropriate inside 
		joke with a colleague about timing your own bathroom breaks.
		<br /><br />
		The application's name was a blatant pun, and the logo works with that.

<h2 class="mt-1">Shoku食Rain</h2>
<div class="flexer col-reverse mb-1 md-row">
	<p>
		This is a logo I made for a cute web game I put together for fun 
		using the Wanikani API. I had fun with it, and it was one of 
		my earliest logo works. I have learned a lot since then, and 
		use a lot more vector tools now.
		<br /><br />
		If I were to remake this logo, I would probably convert it to 
		a flat design. I'd probably change the look of the kanji to 
		fit the rest of it more.

<h2 class="mt-1">The Kana ContrAPPtion</h2>
<div class="flexer col mb-1 md-row-reverse">
	<p>
		Logo for a Japanese language learning mini-game I was making 
		for the Windows Phone! The project never made it to production, 
		but the logo was kind of cute.
		<br /><br />
		It was one of the earliest, if not the first, of my logo works.
