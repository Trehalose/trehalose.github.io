<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	This was for an in-house product at the agency I worked for. It was also one of the earliest 
	projects I worked on at the company. It was a learning experience for both me &amp; the company.
</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<div class="flexer col md-row">
	<div class="tabbed">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Planning phase
				<ul>
					<li>This project was unusual because we worked directly with our client's project management team &amp; their Jira board instead of our own.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Working out tickets
				<ul>
					<li>We set up Docker containers for local environments.</li>
					<li>I would work on the frontend feature &amp; bug tickets.</li>
					<li>Created automated user acceptance testing. until our testing frameworks were deprecated.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

<h2>Hurdles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		It was a minor hurdle to implement the wizard from our codebase into our client's marketing site.
		<ul>
			<li>A different codebase controlled by a different team &amp; company.</li>
			<li>We worked with our team's connection point with their team to get it done.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Our client was <em>very</em> adamant about implementing the Instagram &amp; Facebook APIs, 
		but when the APIs deprecated, the client refused to renew anything.
		<ul>
			<li>We removed the dead APIs from the wizard &amp; backend panel.</li>
			<li>There was no "diffuculty" per se', but it was very confusing &amp; I still think about it a lot.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		I was mercilessly hounded &amp; harassed to make automated user acceptance tests for this application.
		<ul>
			<li>This was the first instance of this type of tests our agency ever used.</li>
			<li>I was an intern at the time &amp; knew nothing about testing, &amp; very little about early React.</li>
			<li>I learned it &amp; did it, but I have a very complicated relationship with writing tests because of it.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div>
	<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Using React, &amp; implementing API calls with the Fetch API.</li>
		<li>User acceptance testing.</li>
		<li>Building with Docker containers.</li>
		<li>A little about PHP.</li>
		<li>The joys &amp; eldritch horrors of early stage GANs image generators.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Those APIs deserve to be re-implemented in the wizard. They added that extra üßë‚Äçüç≥üòôü§å</li>
		<li>Use Cypress for user acceptance testing.</li>
		<li>More support for accessibility in at least the wizard.</li>
	</ul>
