    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      I chose to work on this project because I would personally like a series of fun tools to help me 
      study and stay engaged while studying Japanese. I know that other people would benefit from tools 
      like this too, so I am running on lots of hopes &amp; dreams!

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <div class="tabbed">
      <p>
        I already had the game idea I wanted to make via an epiphany moment. The 
        rest of the work was planning &amp; implementation. Here is how it went~
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ideating the most integral features of the game for release #1.
          <ul>
            <li>This involved research, anecdotal wisdoms, doodling things on paper, &amp; brainstorming sessions.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Breaking said features &amp; how they connect into manageable pieces of work on Trello.</li>
        <li>
          Working in small, week-long sprints.
          <ul>
            <li>Easier to organize these goals with my schedule.</li>
            <li>Easier to split into different task types to prevent burnout.</li>
            <li>Easier to timebox tasks.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Drink a <em>lot</em> of tea &amp; soda.</li>
        <li>
          After a feature was added, I tested it with people, &amp; gathered feedback.
          <ul>
            <li>This eventually stopped after the base game features were tested.</li>
            <li>Testing is planned to resume after private alpha user invitations are sented.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>After setting of the game's core functionalities, I switched focus to the webapp portion of Onkaado in private.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="flexo mt-1 mb-1 col-reverse md-row">
  <div>
    <h2>Hurdles</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Surprise last minute testing feedback.
        <ul>
          <li>I only accidentally found out that many players didn't know they could scroll through their hand of cards on the last day of initial user test.</li>
          <li>This was a lesson in asking more questions &amp; prepping with visuals where appropriate.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>
        3D animations with CSS was a minor issue on Safari browsers.
        <ul>
          <li>Found out from user feedback.</li>
          <li>Did not have a way to test solutions locally.</li>
          <ll>CSS prefixes were the solution.</ll>
          <li>I made fallback solutions to support places where it could not be fixed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        A11Y testing is insufficient <small>(in my opinion)</small>.
        <ul>
          <li>Automated testing is limited.</li>
          <li>I don't have sufficient tooling for full manual testing.</li>
          <li>I make a lot of hopeful guesswork &amp; can only slowly improve the system with the time, feedback, &amp; reserach I can access.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What did I learn?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        My biggest lesson from this project was building up the bravery to run user tests.
        <ul>
          <li>I learned a few lessons from my mistakes in the process as well.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cypress, and A11Y testing with it.</li>
      <li>The whole implementation of websockets on the frontend and backend for game rooms!</li>
      <li>Usage of SVG animation tags!</li>
      <li>How to add highly-customizeable faux images &amp; image components.</li>
      <li>Chron jobs with Node.</li>
      <li>Seeding and migrations for databases.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What would I improve?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the HTML5 Canvas more instead of focusing on SVGs.</li>
      <li>
        The game UI needs to be more game-like.
        <ul>
          <li>I focused too hard on web-application aesthetics.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>
      <li>Better A/B testing tools.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Bonus fact:</h2>
<p>
  Onkaado was originally supposed to be a physical card game with some 
  completely different but cool features for helping players study. The 
  concept was quickly pivoted to a digital one as the 2020 pandemic began, 
  &amp; evidence was piling up that showed heavy favor toward remote 
  tooling. I was surprised, but delighted by the new options~
