<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
	This was for an in-house product at the agency I worked for. It was also one of the earliest 
	projects I worked on at the company. It was a learning experience for both me &amp; the company.

			</li>
			<li>
				Working out tickets
				<ul>
					<li>We set up Docker containers for local environments.</li>

<h2>Hurdles</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
		This project went through multiple automated user acceptance testing frameworks.
		<ul>
			<li>PhantomJS, Casper.js, Puppeteer, &amp; then nothing at all.</li>
			<li>The changes were all related to testing support and deprecation issues.</li>
			<li>Removing testing was part of an internal decision while switching company stacks.</li>
			<li>No clear-cut resolution. ðŸ¤·</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

		<h2>What did I learn?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Building with Docker containers.</li>
			<li>A whole bunch of testing frameworks &amp; practices.</li>
			<li>A little PHP.</li>
			<li>Making logo animations is the bestiest thing in the world-a-ronie!</li>
		</ul>
		<img class="bordered img-wide hauto mb-1 md-mb-0 md-mr-1" src="/assets/imgs/thankscrate/logo-animated.gif" alt="The Thankscrate animated logo." />

		<h2>What would I improve if I did it again?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Start off the automated user acceptance testing with Cypress, which didn't exist at the time.</li>
			<li>Be less dependent on internal libraries that have separate Jira boards &amp; tickets.</li>
		</ul>
