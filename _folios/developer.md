title: "Software Developer"
blurb: "I develop software for web and mobile. My background is in the fine arts, so a lot of my work preferences lean toward the frontend of an application; but don't be fooledâ€” I also enjoy putzing around on the backend! If it helps create a holistic understanding of how a really cool system works and can be improved, I am down to clown. ðŸ¤¡"
